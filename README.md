# PayEx Payment Gateway for Magento 2

The Official PayEx Payment Gateway Extension for Magento 2 can be used in
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland and provides seamless integration with
[PayEx][payex]' rich Payments API. Empower your Magento shop with a user
friendly way to pay and receive payments for the products you have up for sale!

You can configure the extension to receive payments in a number of different
ways, in all Nordic currencies: SEK, NOK, DKK and EUR. Best of all: The

of payment and can settle the order in a secure and user friendly manner
directly in the browser. The Payment Gateway is responsive and works just as
well on desktop as on mobile browsers.
